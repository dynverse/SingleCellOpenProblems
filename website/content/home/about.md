## Integrating the Human Cell Atlas

Thanks to recent advances in single cell technologies, we now have the opportunity to profile the state of millions of cells an unprecedented resolution. Using off-the-shelf reagents and protocols, individual laboratories can measure global gene expression, DNA accessibility, and high dimensional proteomic data. These innovations promise to reveal new levels of biological heterogeneity across tissues, developmental stages, and organisms. Is is the goal of [the Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) to push these boundaries and characterize the complete cellular diversity in the trillions of cells in the human body.

Assembling a Human Cell Atlas will require development of [new computational methods](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6) by groups spanning computational and biological sciences. To facilitate these collaborations, we are aggregating formalized open problems with standardized datasets and test metrics. This approach is inspired by similar challenges in computer science such as the [ImageNet Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) or the [Netflix Prize](https://www.netflixprize.com/) that drive innovation in algorithm development for computationally important tasks. However, with a few notable [exceptions](https://predictioncenter.org/), these challenges do not exist for biological problems.

## Our mission
Our goal is to facilitate the development of novel computational methods to address open problems in integrating the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/). We are focused on bridging the gap between experts in computer science and machine learning and the biological problems associated with the single cell data. We want to identify important problems, aggregate standardized datasets, and create a platform to benchmark novel methods against the current state of the art using a common set of test metrics.

This project is sponsored by the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/), and we are looking for broad input from the scientific community.
